# Snowtires

This is just a tiny little app that authorizes with the Tempest weather API to
pull recent weather observations from a weather station in order to let me know
when to put on or take off my snowtires. Also served as an excuse to try out
lit-html.

If you have a tempest account, you can check out the app [here](https://snowtires.pages.dev). Runs in a cloudflare worker.
